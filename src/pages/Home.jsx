      <p>The technologies of the future are developments that pursue a specific goal. This is a race track with motorcycles equipped with sensors that transmit data faster than the wheels turn. This is a 3D printed bridge over a medieval canal.</p>
      <p>Will be soon. In 30-40 years, scientists predict the emergence of even more useful technologies. People will get an HIV vaccine, 3D-printed organs, an exoskeleton that will make them as strong as the Hulk. And they will also ride in a high-speed pipe, like in Futurama, contactlessly transfer their energy and data from the brain directly to the Internet. It sounds like the script of a science fiction movie, but this is not fiction, but real developments that are already underway today.</p>
