        The technologies of the future are developments that pursue a specific
        goal. This is a race track with motorcycles equipped with sensors that
        transmit data faster than the wheels turn. This is a 3D printed bridge
        over a medieval canal.

      <h3>
        Will be soon. In 30-40 years, scientists predict the emergence of even
        more useful technologies. People will get an HIV vaccine, 3D-printed
        organs, an exoskeleton that will make them as strong as the Hulk.

      <h4>
        And they will also ride in a high-speed pipe, like in Futurama,
        contactlessly transfer their energy and data from the brain directly to
        the Internet. It sounds like the script of a science fiction movie, but
        this is not fiction, but real developments that are already underway
        today.
